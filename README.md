# Monte Carlo Simulation for Computing Pi

This repository contains Python scripts for performing Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the value of Pi.

## Contents

- `montecarlo.py`: Python script for Monte Carlo simulation to estimate Pi.
- `problem-2-b.py`: Python script for creating a graph displaying measured and theoretical speedup.
- `problem-2-c.py`: Python script for making runs of the Monte Carlo simulation repeatable by specifying an explicit random number generator seed.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/monte-carlo-pi.git
   cd monte-carlo-pi
   
Execute the desired Python scripts:

For Monte Carlo simulation and computation of Pi:
bash

python montecarlo.py --steps 1000
For plotting measured and theoretical speedup:
bash

python problem-2-b.py
For making runs of the Monte Carlo simulation repeatable:
bash

python problem-2-c.py
Dependencies

Python 3.x
